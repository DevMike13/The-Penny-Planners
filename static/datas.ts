// description: "Let’s talk about your poop. I know, I know, not the most fascinating topic but when you’re constipated, it’s a major issue. You can feel bloated, fatigues, and uncomfortable. It’s no wonder chronic constipation is a leading cause of doctor visits.<br><br> I consult regularly with Dr. Gina Sam, considered by many in the medical field to be the world's foremost authority on 'gut motility' (which is just a fancy way of saying 'pooping speed.') And she revealed that most digestion \"remedies\" actually do more harm than good:<br><br> - Fiber feeds bacteria and parasites<br> - Laxatives actually destroy parts of the colon<br> - Probiotics are counter-productive when taken orally<br><br>Instead, her years of research uncovered a simple solution: a gut fix that I call <a href='#' target='_blank'><u><i><b>\"the instant fat flush\"</b></i></u></a>. It takes just 7 seconds in the morning and can flush out some 10 to 15 pounds of that backed-up poop in your gut. This remarkable solution has already helped over 19,000 formerly-constipated Americans restore their digestive process. <br><br> Like Michelle S., who says it's <i>\"been a godsend. It's only been 2 weeks and I'm already pooping like I did as a teenager.\"</i> <br><br> <a href='#' target='_blank'><i><b><u>>> Discover the new 7-second poop releasing ritual</u></b></i></a> <br> <br> Because the truth is, you can enjoy your favorite foods without bloating or unexplained weight gain. And it literally takes just 7 seconds. People from all over the world have chosen this go-to solution whenever they have constipation, bloating or heartburn issues. There's a good reason so many people are crediting it with giving them their life back. Check it out <a href='#' target='_blank'><b><u><i>here</i></b></u></a> today and your tummy will thank you for it! ",
